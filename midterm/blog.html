    <h2>Entry 1</h2>

    <p>At home you have unlimited time. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.
      
      The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.
      
      See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Anyone can paint. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.</p>

    <p>Learn when to stop. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. See there how easy that is. Don't fiddle with it all day.
      
      And just raise cain. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Let's make a happy little mountain now. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. This painting comes right out of your heart.
      
      It all happens automatically. A beautiful little sunset. Let's do that again. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>

    <h2>Entry 3</h2>
    <div class="gallery"><img src="img/diagonal2.png" alt="diagonal2" width="280"></div>
    <p>Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Be brave. Let's have a happy little tree in here. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.
      
      A big strong tree needs big strong roots. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.
      
      Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Let's make a happy little.</p>
